## Introduction
This project is based on a diabetes patient dataset.
The aim is to understand patterns such as age, glucose level, BMI, and their relationship with diabetes.

## Data Upload
First, download the dataset.
Then write code to upload the file in Google Colab.

## Load & View Data
Python commands are used to load and view the uploaded data.

## Basic Dataset Information
- Column types show the kind of data stored in each column.
- Missing values refer to empty or undefined entries.

## Statistical Summary
The `describe()` function provides:
- Mean
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Standard deviation
- Quartiles

## Missing Data Check
The `isnull().sum()` command helps identify incomplete data before further analysis.

## Dataset Basic Visualization

### Age Distribution
A histogram showing how ages are spread across the dataset.

### Glucose Levels
A histogram showing low, normal, and high glucose ranges.

### BMI vs Glucose
A scatter plot showing the relationship between BMI and glucose levels.

## Result
- High glucose levels strongly indicate diabetes likelihood.
- Higher BMI increases risk.
- Older age groups show more diabetes cases.

## Conclusion
The dataset highlights glucose level, BMI, and age as major factors influencing diabetes risk.
Visualizations and summaries help understand how these values vary and their impact on health management.
